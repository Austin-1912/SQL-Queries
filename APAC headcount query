Hi Team,

May I have a query script that allow me to pull these KPIs?
Super region: APAC
Country: All APAC countries
Period: 21 Dec to 27 Dec (the script should be flexible for me to edit the period range)

Metrics:
Total registration
Total new Customers
Total customers
Total transactions
Total Revenue
