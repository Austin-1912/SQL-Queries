I’m reaching out for a weekly data pull request for total digital new customers in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada.

For context, we launched a large Out-Of-Home media buy that we haven’t done before and we’d like to measure the impact that it has on digital new customer acquisition.

 

The OOH campaign will be running from September 30 – November 30.

 

Could your team pull the following:

 

Pre-Campaign:

Week 1: September 16 - 22

Week 2: September 23 - 29

 

Campaign:

Week 1: September 30 – October 6

Week 2: October 7 - 13

Week 3: October 14 - 20

Week 4: October 21 – 27

Week 5: October 28 – November 3

Week 6: November 4 - 10

Week 7: November 11 – 17

Week 8: November 18 – 24

Week 9: November 25 – December 1

However, I had a couple of questions regarding the measurement approach. From what I understand, you're considering a pre-post analysis. Would it also be possible to include a comparison with another city—ideally one similar in size to Toronto but without the billboard presence? This would help account for any seasonality effects and strengthen the analysis.

Regarding the pre-post analysis, we could compare against Vancouver, British Columbia or Montreal, Quebec. 

 

Those are generally the other biggest cities in Canada but Toronto is the biggest. 

 

Another thought could be to compare Toronto against “Rest of Canada excluding Toronto” to see how the country average is performing vs the OOH heavy-up in Toronto.
