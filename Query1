I have created a matrix table where in rows i have put in the parameter selection and i have put it in slicer as well
Parameter Selection = {
    ("Audience Segment", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[AUDIENCE_SEGMENT]), 0, "Customer Engagement Group"),
    ("Active Breakdown", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[Active Breakdown 2]), 1, "Customer Engagement Group"),
    ("Country", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[LACA_COUNTRY]), 2, "Geographic & Corridor Group"),
    ("Dominant Channel", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[CHANNEL_DOMINANCE]), 6, "Channel & Marketability Group"),
    ("Channel Native", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[CHANNEL_NATIVE]), 7, "Channel & Marketability Group"),
    ("Marketability Segment", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[MARKETABILITY_SEGMENT]), 8, "Channel & Marketability Group"),
    ("Corridor", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[CORRIDOR_GROUP]), 5, "Geographic & Corridor Group"),
    
    ("Dominant Sndcountry", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[DOMINANT_SNDCOUNTRY_NAME]),3,"Geographic & Corridor Group"),
    ("Dominant Rcvcountry", NAMEOF('LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL'[DOMINANT_RCVCOUNTRY_NAME]),4, "Geographic & Corridor Group")
}
in columns i have month label which has Jan 2025 to Sept 2025
in values i have sum of Total customers which is a measure : Total Customers = SUM(LACA_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_FINAL[Total Customer Count])
Now help me create a YOY in % and MOM in % which i can show along with the total customers and maybe add a slicer to switch between
the total customer, YOY and MOM. if you need any other detail do let me know.
