Requirement given by the requestor: 
we would like to have more insights into who our Consumer Services (C2B) customers are in the US: customers who use products such as Prepaid Card, Bill Pay. Is there a way to categorize customers who use C2B only, and C2B+Money Transfer, Money Transfer only as well? Ideally if we can also split it by specific product.

We would like to see (if available) any demographics of the customers, main DMA/State where they transact, etc, similar to the prison pay document I am sharing.
